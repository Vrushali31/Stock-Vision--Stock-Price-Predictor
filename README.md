Our application “Stock Vision” makes investing easy. The prediction of stock value is a complex task which needs a robust algorithm background  in  order  to  compute  the  longer  term  share prices. Stock prices are correlated within the nature of the market, hence it will be difficult to predict the costs. The proposed algorithm uses the  market  data  to predict the  share price  using  machine learning techniques like recurrent neural networks named as Long Short Term Memory. In that process weights are corrected for each data point using stochastic gradient descent. The network is trained and evaluated with various sizes of input data to urge the graphical outcomes.

This application is only capable of predicting a particular stock’s present day closing price. Dataset is fetched from Yahoo Finance, on which the model is trained to predict stock prices of only 5 Companies.
